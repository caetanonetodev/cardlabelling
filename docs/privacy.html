    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 13, 2026</p>

    <p>QuickCard Scanner ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data.</p>

    <h2>1. On-Device Processing</h2>
    <p>QuickCard Scanner performs all OCR (optical character recognition) and AI-based contact parsing entirely on your device. No images of business cards, scanned text, or contact information are transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers for processing.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>

    <h3 style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 8px;">2.1 Data Stored on Your Device</h3>
    <p>The following data is stored locally on your device and, if you have iCloud enabled, synced to your private iCloud account via Apple's CloudKit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scanned business card images and thumbnails</li>
        <li>Extracted contact information (names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, job titles, companies)</li>
        <li>Tags, categories, notes, and favorites you assign to contacts</li>
        <li>Your digital business card information</li>
        <li>App preferences and settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not have access to this data. It remains entirely under your control.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 8px;">2.2 Analytics Data</h3>
    <p>We use Google Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data to help us improve the app. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>App opens and session duration</li>
        <li>Feature usage events (e.g., number of scans, subscription actions)</li>
        <li>Device type, operating system version, and app version</li>
        <li>Crash reports and performance diagnostics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally. No contact information, card images, or personal data from your scans is included in analytics.</p>

    <h3 style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-top: 16px; margin-bottom: 8px;">2.3 Purchase Data</h3>
    <p>Subscription purchases are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store your payment information, Apple ID, or billing details.</p>

    <h2>3. iCloud Sync</h2>
    <p>If you have iCloud enabled on your device, your scanned cards and digital business card may sync across your Apple devices through Apple's CloudKit service. This data is stored in your private iCloud container and is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>. We do not have access to your iCloud data.</p>

    <h2>4. iPhone Contacts</h2>
    <p>QuickCard Scanner can save scanned contacts to your iPhone Contacts app with your explicit permission. We only write contact data that you choose to save. We do not read, upload, or share your existing contacts.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses the following third-party service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase Analytics</strong> - For anonymous usage analytics and crash reporting. Firebase's privacy policy is available at <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>All scanned card data is stored on your device (and optionally in your iCloud account). You can delete individual cards or all data at any time from within the app. Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>QuickCard Scanner is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since your data is stored on your device and in your private iCloud account, you have full control over it at all times. You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>View, edit, or delete any scanned card</li>
        <li>Export your data in multiple formats (vCard, CSV, JSON)</li>
        <li>Delete all app data from the Settings screen</li>
        <li>Disable iCloud sync in your device's Settings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.</p>
